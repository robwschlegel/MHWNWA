# What are marine heatwaves? 

## Definition

<font size="5">"A prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent." </font>

</center>
  
* The temperature at a location exceeds the 90% percentile of that calendar day    
* This occurs at least 5 days in a row with no more than a 2 day gap thereafter    

## Methods {.tabset}

### Time series
<center>
![](graph/ts_full.png){ width=90% }
</center>  
  
* First we start with a normal temperature time series
    * Temperature (°C) on the y-axis, date on the x-axis

### Day of year
<center>
![](graph/ts_box.png){ width=90% }
</center>
  
* Then we clump all of the same days of the year (doy) together
* The range of values for each doy are shown here as boxplots

### Climatologies
<center>
![](graph/ts_box_clim.png){ width=90% }
</center>
  
* We smooth these values with an 11-day moving average while finding the:
    * mean _seasonal signal_ (blue line) & 90th percentile _threshold_ (red line)
* These both are then smoothed with a 31-day moving average

## Results {.tabset}

### Events
<center>
![](graph/MHW_flame.png)
</center>
  
* Any temperatures above the _threshold_ for 5+ days are marked as a marine heatwave

### Categories
<center>
![](graph/MHW_category.png)
</center>

* There is also a more qualitative ranking system [@Hobday2018]

### Event metrics
<center>
![](graph/MHW_lolli.png)
</center>
  
* Summary metrics for each event are created
* Here the max intensity of each event is shown with a lolliplot

## In practice

[Marine Heatwave Tracker](http://www.marineheatwaves.org/tracker)

# Why should we care? 
  
* Marine heatwaves are increasing in duration and intensity globally [@Oliver2018]
* We already know of many marine heatwaves that have had dire consequences

## Infamous marine heatwaves {.tabset}

### Mediterranean - 2003

<center>
![](graph/gorgonian_fan.jpg){ width=70% }
</center>

* Cause - Atmospheric forcing  
* Effect - Gorgonian mortality up to 80% [@Garrabou2009]

### Western Australia - 2010/11

<center>
![Thomas Wernberg](graph/WA_kelp_change.jpg)  
(_Thomas Wernberg_)
</center>  
  
* Cause - La Nina + Abnormal Leeuwin Current movement onto coast  [@Feng2013; @Benthuysen2014]
* Effect - Permanent loss of more than 100 km of kelp forests [@Wernberg2016]

### North West Atlantic - 2012

<center>
![](graph/lobster.jpeg)
</center>

* Cause - Interactions between Labrador Current and Gulf Stream [@Brickman2018]
* Effect - Range shifts, early lobsters, CAN vs. USA [@Mills2013]

### "The Blob" North East Pacific - 2014/16

<center>
![EPA](graph/dead_sea_lions.jpg){ width=70% }  
(_EPA_)
</center>  
  
* Cause - Warm winter, poor mixing, high SLP, air-sea flux, followed by an El Nino [@Bond2015a]
* Effect - Practically every trophic level negatively impacted to some degree

# What are we doing about it?

## International Working Group

<center>
![http://www.marineheatwaves.org/](graph/working_group_screen_shot.png)  
</center>

## Programming languages

* It is currently possible to calculate marine heatwaves in:
    * Python: <https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves>
    * R: <https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/index.html>
    * MATLAB: <https://github.com/ZijieZhaoMMHW/m_mhw1.0>

## Databases
  
<center>
![Link available soon!](graph/MHW_tracker_screen.png){ width=100% }  
</center>

* One may also download marine heatwave results from the daily updating Marine Heatwave Tracker
    * Contains climatologies, event metrics, and categories

## Machine learning {.tabset}

* Are there recurrent environmental patterns during marine heatwaves?
* If so, can these be detected/quantified by a computer?

### Definition 

<center>

</center>    
  
<font size="5">"A field of study concerned with the design and development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn." </font>    
(_Wiktionary_)

### Stress

</center>
![](graph/cat_herd.gif){ width=110% }
</center> 

* The computer "learns" by reducing stress

***

### Clustering

<center> 
![](graph/K-mean kats.png)  
(_Angé Ackerman_)
</center> 

* After ordinating the data the computer tries to find the most similar clusters for them

***

### Self-organising maps {.tabset}

#### Self-organising cats

<center>

(_Angé Ackerman_)
</center> 

* With self-organising maps the computer then arranges the clusters

# Where are we going?

* Find common global patterns between marine heatwaves and environmental variables
    * Move towards methods of prediction
* Database for quantified effects of marine heatwaves on biology/ecology/fisheries
    * Expand the applicability of the Marine Heatwave Tracker
* Begin using models and reanalyses to understand depth of marine heatwaves

## Ordination

<center>
![](graph/MDS.png){ width=90% }
</center>
  
* Note how the daily synoptic states form a smooth ellipsoid
* Then note how scattered the marine heatwave synoptic states are
