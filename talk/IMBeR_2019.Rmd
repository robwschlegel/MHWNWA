# Introduction

## What are marine heatwaves? 

<!-- ## Definition -->

<font size="5">"A prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent." </font>

* The temperature at a location exceeds the 90% percentile of that calendar day    
* This occurs at least 5 days in a row with no more than a 2 day gap thereafter    

## In practice

[Marine Heatwave Tracker](http://www.marineheatwaves.org/tracker)

## Databases
  
<center>
![marineheatwaves.org/tracker](graph/Nova_Scotia_2012_MHW.png){ width=100% }  
</center>

* One may also download marine heatwave results from the daily updating Marine Heatwave Tracker
    * Contains climatologies, event metrics, and categories

## What causes them?

* Different regions of the world show different primary drivers
* For much of the coastal oceans the primary driver is abnormal movement of warm currents onto the coast
* For large seas (i.e. the Mediterannean) warm air plays a more important role


## What are the drivers for MHWs in the NW Atlanttic?

![](graph/fig_1.png)

# Methods {.tabset}

## Sub/regions

- The coastline of Atlantic Canada was divided into several regions based on @Richaud2016
- These regions were then divided into three sub-regions each based on bottom depth:
  - 0 - 50 m
  - 50 - 200 m 
  - 200+ m

![](graph/regions.png)

## SST time series

- All of the SST data for pixels within each sub-region were averaged together

![](graph/)

## Marine heatwaves (MHWs)

- MHWs calculated from each average SST time series

![](graph/)

## Synoptic states

- Average anomaly abiotic synoptic states created during each MHW


## Self-organising map

- Anomalies fed to SOM to produce 12 most common states
- The occurrence of these states with sub-regions and/or seasons quantified


## Machine learning {.tabset}

* Are there recurrent environmental patterns during marine heatwaves?
* If so, can these be detected/quantified by a computer?

### Definition

<font size="5">"A field of study concerned with the design and development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn." </font>

### Stress

</center>
![](graph/cat_herd.gif){ width=110% }
</center> 

* The computer "learns" by reducing stress

***

### Clustering

<center> 
![](graph/K-mean kats.png)  
(_Angé Ackerman_)
</center> 

* After ordinating the data the computer tries to find the most similar clusters for them

### Self-organising maps {.tabset}

#### Self-organising cats

* With self-organising maps the computer then arranges the clusters

<!-- ### Time series -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](graph/ts_full.png){ width=90% } -->
<!-- </center>   -->
  
<!-- * First we start with a normal temperature time series -->
    <!-- * Temperature (°C) on the y-axis, date on the x-axis -->

<!-- ### Day of year -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](graph/ts_box.png){ width=90% } -->
<!-- </center> -->
  
<!-- * Then we clump all of the same days of the year (doy) together -->
<!-- * The range of values for each doy are shown here as boxplots -->

<!-- ### Climatologies -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](graph/ts_box_clim.png){ width=90% } -->
<!-- </center> -->
  
<!-- * We smooth these values with an 11-day moving average while finding the: -->
    <!-- * mean _seasonal signal_ (blue line) & 90th percentile _threshold_ (red line) -->
<!-- * These both are then smoothed with a 31-day moving average -->

# Results {.tabset}

- The primary difference in synoptic states is a dipole between a warm (cold) Gulf Stream and cold (warm) Labrador Sea (Figure \@ref(fig:synoptic-sst))
- More nuanced patterns are .....
- Sub-mesoscale patterns are ......
- By season ......
- By region ......

<!-- ### Events -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](graph/MHW_flame.png) -->
<!-- </center> -->
  
<!-- * Any temperatures above the _threshold_ for 5+ days are marked as a marine heatwave -->

<!-- ### Categories -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](graph/MHW_category.png) -->
<!-- </center> -->

<!-- * There is also a more qualitative ranking system [@Hobday2018] -->

<!-- ### Event metrics -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](graph/MHW_lolli.png) -->
<!-- </center> -->
  
<!-- * Summary metrics for each event are created -->
<!-- * Here the max intensity of each event is shown with a lolliplot -->


<!-- ## Programming languages -->

<!-- * It is currently possible to calculate marine heatwaves in: -->
    <!-- * Python: <https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves> -->
    <!-- * R: <https://robwschlegel.github.io/heatwaveR/index.html> -->
    <!-- * MATLAB: <https://github.com/ZijieZhaoMMHW/m_mhw1.0> -->


# Where are we going?

* Find common global patterns between marine heatwaves and environmental variables
    * Move towards methods of prediction
* Database for quantified effects of marine heatwaves on biology/ecology/fisheries
    * Expand the applicability of the Marine Heatwave Tracker
* Begin using models and reanalyses to understand depth of marine heatwaves

## Ordination

<center>
![](graph/MDS.png){ width=90% }
</center>
  
* Note how the daily synoptic states form a smooth ellipsoid
* Then note how scattered the marine heatwave synoptic states are
