# Marine heatwaves (MHWs)

## Definition

<br>

<font size="5">"A prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent." </font>  
  
[@Hobday2016]

<br>
  
* The temperature at a location exceeds the 90% percentile of that calendar day    
* This occurs at least 5 days in a row with no more than a 2 day gap thereafter

# How does heat enter/exit the ocean?

## Surface heat flux (W/m^2^):

* Q~s~: The short wave energy radiated from the sun (shortwave radiation)  
* Q~l~: The net long-wave energy radiated back from the ocean (longwave radiation)  
* Q~e~: The heat loss by evaporation (latent heat flux)  
* Q~h~: The sensible heat loss by conduction (sensible heat flux)
* Q~net~ = Q~s~ + Q~l~ + Q~e~ + Q~h~ (net positive downward heat flux)

## Surface movement

* **u~mix~** = (u~mix~, v~mix~): Horizontal velocity averaged within the mixed layer
* ∇~h~ = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y): Horizontal gradient operator
* **u~mix~**$\cdot$$\triangledown$~h~T~mix~ = Temperature change due to horizontal advection

## Mixed layer depth

* H: MLD (mixed-layer depth)
* T~mix~: MLD temperature
* $\rho$~0~: Density of sea water
* c~p~: Specific heat of sea water

## Surface temperature

$\delta$T~mix~ /  $\delta$t = ( (Q~net~ - (Q~s~(-H))) / $\rho$~0~c~p~H ) - **u~mix~**$\cdot$$\nabla$~h~T~mix~ + (*res*)

## Known drivers of past MHWs

* Advection and heat flux are the primary drivers of SST
* For much of the coastal oceans the primary driver is abnormal movement (advection) of warm currents into the nearshore
* For large seas (i.e. the Mediterranean) warm air (heat flux) plays a more important role
* The primary drivers of MHWs are generally determined by analysing the contribution of heat budget terms to the occurrence of one large event at a time

# Methods

## What is problematic with the current methodology?

* Large MHWs are happening too rapidly to spend a year working on them one at a time
* Smaller events may also be important
* The use of self-organising maps (SOM) to identify MHW drivers has already been tested
* This technique allows a machine to clarify for us which drivers are most prominent during hundreds of MHWs simultaneously
* We are effectively asking these two questions:
  1. Are there recurrent environmental patterns during marine heatwaves?
  2. If so, can these be detected/quantified by the computer?

## Study area

* The coastline of the Northwest Atlantic, divided into six regions based on their SST and SSS climatologies [@Richaud2016]

![](graph/NWA_study_area.png){ width=80% }  


## MHW detection

* All of the SST pixels within each region were averaged together into one time series
* MHWs were calculated from these six averaged time series
* A total of 289 MHWs were detected

## Data packets

* One data packet was created for each detected MHW
* These packets consisted of the mean anomalous air/sea state during that MHW
* The physical variables in these packets were: SST, U, V, t2m, U10, V10, MLD, Q~net~
* All 289 data packets were then fed to the SOM to produce the 12 most common synoptic air/sea patterns

# Results

# Conclusions

* The nodes tell three main stories:
  * Warm GS + air pushing up from south along coast
  * Warm air sitting over entire coast
  * Warm air being pushed over the AO from the South/Southeast onto the coast
* A few nodes tell smaller stories:
  * Short lived storms that barely manage to perturb T~mix~ for long enough to qualify as a MHW
  * These are distinctly different from the patterns associated with intense MHWs
* Overall the most intense MHWs occur during Autumn/Winter when they match patterns that are normally seen in Summer
* It is likely that this SOM technique will not work on scales larger than one meso-scale feature at a time
