## Introduction

This vignette will show the summary figures for the various SOM experiments. The code used to create these summary figures may be found in `code/functions.R` and a more detailed overview is given in the [Figures vignette](https://robwschlegel.github.io/MHWNWA/node-summary.html). The SOM experiments are given below by name and abbreviation. Within each experiment, the individual nodes are listed below by their number. Use the table of contents on the left of the screen to move quickly between SOM experiments and their nodes of interest as desired.

## Visualise SOM results

With the following lines of code we create PDFs for each of the variables for each of the nodes for our different conditions. These PDFs may be seen at `output/SOM/*`, where `*` is the code name denoting which SOM experiment was conducted.

```{r som-visualise, eval=FALSE}
# Load all functions etc.
source("code/functions.R")

# All data
  # Note that this will be cropped to the same study area as the no LS run
som_all <- readRDS("data/som_all.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som_all, dir_name = "all")

# No Labrador Shelf
som_nolab <- readRDS("data/som_nolab.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som_nolab, dir_name = "no_ls")

# Na Lab or GSL
som_nolabgsl <- readRDS("data/som_nolabgsl.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som_nolabgsl, dir_name = "no_ls_gsl")

# Na Lab, 9 nodes
som_nolab_9 <- readRDS("data/som_nolab_9.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som_nolab_9, dir_name = "no_ls_3x3", col_num = 3)

# Na Lab, 16 nodes
som_nolab_16 <- readRDS("data/som_nolab_16.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som_nolab_16, dir_name = "no_ls_4x4")

# Na Lab and no moderate events
som_nolabmod <- readRDS("data/som_nolabmod.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som_nolabmod, dir_name = "no_ls_mod", col_num = 2)

# No Lab and no events shorter than 14 days
som_nolab14 <- readRDS("data/som_nolab14.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som_nolab14, dir_name = "no_ls_14", col_num = 3)
```

Juggling back and forth between the SST anomaly figures with and without the Gulf of St Lawrence it first appears that they are very different, but this is mostly due to the top and bottom rows of nodes being flipped. The actual differences are much more muted and the patterns tend to hold. The patterns appear more crisp in the larger of the two study extents. This is likely because the inclusion of the shallow GSL gives more power to the atmospheric variables to compete with the Gulf Stream. For this reason we are going to proceed with the inclusion of the Gulf of St Lawrence.

Looking at different counts of nodes it appears as though 9 may not be enough. When 12 nodes are used more detail comes through. Going up to 16 nodes appear to be too much as not much more detail comes through while creating the complexity of more node results to sift through. When the moderate events are removed we are left with only 37 events (synoptic states) to feed the SOM. This means we shouldn't use more than 4 nodes so as not to (be just shy of) at least 10 potential values binned into each node. The four nodes that are output do show the most clear difference in patterns and actually do a surprising job of encapsulating the different potential drivers of MHWs. An ANOSIM test on the nodes show that they are different with a _p_ = 0.046. All of the other results have a ANOSIM of _p_ = 0.001. One issue with screening the events by category is that this part of the ocean experiences many long category I Moderate events that may still be relevant.

So rather than screen by category, I also made a run on the SOM with MHW data with events shorter than 14 days removed. This left us with 103 events to work with, which is a good number to use with a 3x3 grid. The results tell perhaps a clearer story than with the 12 nodes and all MHWs. 

Just from going over the node summaries created in this vignette it is too difficult to say conclusively which SOM experiment produces the clearest results. We will need to go over the summary figures in much more detail in order to get a better idea of how well this is working out. Also unresolved in this vignette is the criticism that the methodology used for the creation of the mean synoptic states fed to the SOM is weak to long events coming through as "grey", meaning they average out to a rather unremarkable state, even though they are likely the most important of all. One proposed fix for this is to create synoptic states using only the peak date of the event, rather than a mean over the range of the event. This should be looked into...

A last point here is that this methodology should also be useful for looking backwards and forwards through time to see what the synoptic states looked like leading up to and just after the event. This information could be more useful than the first wave of results. Before doing this however a singular methodology needs to be pinned down (i.e. which events to screen and how many nodes to use).

See the files in the `/output/SOM_nodes/` folder in the GitHub repo for this project. They aren't all shown here because they take a bit too long to render. 
<!-- But the following shows what the SST anomaly nodes look like. -->

## Figure summary key

The summariesfor the figures below have a lot of acronyms in them but they are consistently used and I will provide a list of what they are here. Whenever one sees an acronym in lower case letters it is referring to one of the regions of the study area as seen in the following figure.

```{r study-regions, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The regions of the coast were devided up by their temperature and salinity regimes based on work by @Richaud2016. The regions were furthered divided into sub-regions based on their depth.'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/NAPA/study_regions.png")
```

The region abbreviations are:  

- gm = Gulf of Maine
- gls = Gulf of St. Lawrence  
- ls = Labrador Shelf  
- mab = Mid-Atlantic Bight
- nfs = Newfoundland Shelf  
- ss = Scotian Shelf  

The upper case acronyms used in the following figure captions are as follows:  

- SST = Sea surface temperature
- SOM = Self-organising map(s)
- GS = Gulf Stream
- AO = Atlantic Ocean
- LS = Labrador Sea
- LC = Labrador Current
- NS = Nova Scotia

It is also worth noting that the scales used to show the variables in the individual node summary figures are not the same across all of the nodes. This was an intentional decision as it allows for more detail to emerge within each node summary. The overall comparisons of nodes are to be done on the figures that show only 2 or 3 variables for all of the nodes at once.

## SOM experiment: No Labrador Shelf region (default), 4x3 nodes

There are a total of 289 MHWs considered when putting this 12 node (4x3) SOM together. The largest conetration of MHWs is into the middle two SOM nodes (6 + 7), where there are twice as many events as some of the side and corner nodes. The top left corner, node 1, also has a large amount of events palced within it and the diagonally opposite node (12) has a decent number. Overall I would not have said that any of the nodes have notably fewer events, but further analysis shows that node 8 (middle right) is mostly poupulated by MHWs from one large event.

### Node summary table

The table below contains a concise summary of the nodes following Table 4 in @Oliver2018tasmania. The following sub-sections provide more in-depth explanations.

```{r}
# knitr::kable(x = data.frame(node = c(1:12),
#                             Region = c(""),
#                             Season = c(""),
#                             MHW_Propeties = c(""),
#                             Conditions = c(""), 
#                             stringsAsFactors = F))
```

|Node|Region    |Season    |MHW Properties    |Conditions       |
|----|----------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
|1   | | | | |

### Season + region

In the figure below we most quickly see that the proportion of MHWs occurring in the middle two nodes are summer events. The seasons are determined by the mnth during which the peak of the event occurred, with `Winter = JFM` etc. The nodes on the right-hand have mostly events from the mab. The distribution becomes more even as we move to the centre with the left-hand nodes having mostly nfs and gsl events. The bottom left node has almost no summer events. 

```{r no-ls-season-summary, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/fig_5.png")
```

### SST + U + V

The only U + V anomaly pattern I see is that the centre nodes (6 + 7) and the opposite corners of nodes 1 + 12 show little strength/vorticity in the GS while the other nodes tend to show more. The strength of the GS is apparent in node 8, and the vorticity in the eddy field is very apparent in node 5. 

For SST we see moving from the right to the left the LS anomaly tends to go from cool to warm. As we move from the top down the AO tends to become warmer. The gm, gsl, and ss regions are warm in all of the nodes. Most of the SST is anomalously warm in the middle two nodes. 

```{r no-ls-sst-summary, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/fig_2.png")
```

### Air temp + U + V

Here we see much clearer patterns. 

For air temperature anomalies we see that the air above the LS gets warmer as we move left and down. The air over the USA becomes warmer as we move to the right. Most of the air in the middle two nodes is warm. The air over the AO becomes warmer as we move down the nodes.

One consistent pattern across all of the U + V values is that the top and right-hand sides have strong anomalous wind movement down from the Northeast corner while the bottom right corner nodes have strong northward wind anomalies in their top right corners.

On the right-hand side of the nodes we see generally anti-cyclonic wind movement around a thermal dipole with the southward moving air being anomolously warm. The colder (warmer) th air temperature the faster south (north) the anomalous wind movement is. In the second right-most column (nodes 3 +7 +11) we also see anticyclonic wind anomalies around thermal dipoles. The central position of the anticyclone is different in each node, and the thermal anomalies tend to be less than the right-hand column. Te left-hand two columns have cyclonic wind movement around thermal dipoles with the stronger patterns in the far left column. Node 10 is a bit different in that it appears to have anticyclonic wind movement, but a cold dipole that looks more like the cyclonic movement nodes. The cetnre two nodes have the smaller wind patterns, with node 6 the smallest.

```{r no-ls-t2m-summary, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/fig_3.png")
```

### MLD + Net downward heatflux

The MLD in the AO in the top nodes is generally deeper, and shoals as we move to the bottom row. The MLD in the LS is deeper in the right-hand column and shoals as we move left. The MLD for the mab is deeper in the left-hand column and shoals as we move to the right.

The gradients of net downward heatflux change nicely across the nodes and generally speaking we see more positive downward heatflux over areas with anomalously shallow water. There is little happening in the centre two nodes. There is high positive downward heatflux over the LS in the bottom left node (9) with negative heatflux over the mab. This positive heatflux gradient slowly moves over the AO as we move from the left to the right along the bottom row of nodes. There is a negative downward heatflux gradient over the mab in the top left node (1) that slowly moves up and over to the LS as we move towards node 4. This negative gradient is replaced by a positive gradient.

```

### Node 1

This node has a pretty even split of months of occurrence, with a lean towards summer and away from winter. Most of the events took place in the nfs, cbs, or gsl. The most intense events in this node occurred in Autumn/Winter of 2010/11. There are events from 1999 to 2017 with more events in the later half. There is a big mix of very small and somehwat large events for both cumulative and max intensities.

The Sutheast AO tends to be cold with a warm GSL and LS. Looking closely one may see that the GS is slightly anomalously slow. The atmosphere is dominated by a cyclonic dipole offshore of the mab/gm. The Southeast AO is up to 20 metres deeper than usual with a negative downward heatflux over it. The LS is shallow but there is not much positive heatflux into it, with the exception of two curiously concentrated points.
