## Introduction

This vignette shows the summary figures for the SOM rsults. The code used to create these summary figures may be found in `code/functions.R` and a more detailed overview is given in the `code/functions.R`. Figures showing the synoptic states for pairs of variables for all of the nodes at once are shown first, followed by multi-panel summary plots for each individual node, which are listed below by their number. Use the table of contents on the left of the screen to move quickly between variables and specific nodes of interest as desired.

## Visualise SOM results

The following code chunk creates PDFs and PNGs for each of the variables for each of the nodes. These images may be seen at `output/SOM/`.

```{r som-visualise, eval=FALSE}
# Load all functions etc.
source("code/functions.R")

# Create the full range of visuals
som <- readRDS("data/som.Rda")
som_node_visualise(som)
```

<!-- Jumping back and forth between the SST anomaly figures with and without the Gulf of St Lawrence (gsl) it first appears that they are very different, but this is mostly due to the top and bottom rows of nodes being flipped. The actual differences are much more muted and the patterns tend to hold. The patterns appear more crisp in the larger of the two study extents. This is likely because the inclusion of the shallow gsl gives more power to the atmospheric variables to compete with the Gulf Stream. For this reason we are going to proceed with the inclusion of the gsl region. -->

<!-- Looking at different counts of nodes it appears as though 9 may not be enough. When 12 nodes are used more detail comes through. Going up to 16 nodes appear to be too much as not much more detail is gained while creating the complexity of more node results to sift through. When the moderate events are removed we are left with only 37 events (synoptic states) to feed the SOM. This means we shouldn't use more than 4 nodes so as not to (be just shy of) at least 10 potential values binned into each node. The four nodes that are output do show the most clear difference in patterns and actually do a surprising job of encapsulating the different potential drivers of MHWs. An ANOSIM test on the nodes show that they are different with a _p_ = 0.046. All of the other results have a ANOSIM of _p_ = 0.001. One issue with screening the events by category is that this part of the ocean experiences many long category I Moderate events that may still be relevant. -->

<!-- So rather than screen by category, I also made a run on the SOM with MHW data with events shorter than 14 days removed. This left us with 103 events to work with, which is a good number to use with a 3x3 grid. The results tell perhaps a clearer story than with the 9 or 12 nodes and all MHWs.  -->

<!-- Just from going over the node summaries created in this vignette it is too difficult to say conclusively which SOM experiment produces the clearest/best results. We will need to go over the summary figures in much more detail in order to get a better idea of how well this is working out. Also unresolved in this vignette is the criticism that the methodology used for the creation of the mean synoptic states fed to the SOM is weak to long events coming through as "grey", meaning they average out to a rather unremarkable state, even though they are likely the most important of all. One proposed fix for this is to create synoptic states using only the peak date of the event, rather than a mean over the range of the event. This should be looked into... -->

<!-- A last point here is that this methodology should also be useful for looking backwards and forwards through time to see what the synoptic states looked like leading up to and just after the event. Before considering doing this however a single methodology needs to be pinned down (i.e. which events to screen and how many nodes to use). -->

## Figure summary key

The summaries for the figures below have a lot of acronyms in them but they are consistently used and I will provide a list of what they are here. Whenever one sees an acronym in lower case letters it is referring to one of the regions of the study area as seen in the following figure.

```{r study-regions, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The regions of the coast were devided up by their temperature and salinity regimes based on work by @Richaud2016. The regions were furthered divided into sub-regions based on their depth.'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/NAPA/study_regions.png")
```

The region abbreviations are:  

- cbs = Cabot Straight
- gm = Gulf of Maine
- gls = Gulf of St. Lawrence  
- ls = Labrador Shelf  **NO LONGER USED**
- mab = Mid-Atlantic Bight
- nfs = Newfoundland Shelf  
- ss = Scotian Shelf  

The upper case acronyms used in the following figure captions are as follows:  

- SST = Sea surface temperature
- SOM = Self-organising map(s)
- GS = Gulf Stream
- AO = Atlantic Ocean
- LS = Labrador Sea
- LC = Labrador Current
- NS = Nova Scotia
- CN = Canada
- US = United States

It is also worth noting that the scales used to show the variables in the individual node summary figures are not the same across all of the nodes. This was an intentional decision as it allows for more detail to emerge within each node summary. The overall comparisons of nodes are to be done on the figures that show only 2 or 3 variables for all of the nodes at once.

The written summary of each individual node below is broken into three pieces: 1) the MHW metrics, region + season + years of occurrence; 2) the patterns observed in the physical variables; 3) a sentence stating what appears to be the main driver/pattern.

## SOM results

There are a total of 289 MHWs considered when putting this 12 node (4x3) SOM together. The largest concentration of MHWs is into the middle two SOM nodes (6 + 7), where there are twice as many events as some of the side and corner nodes. The top left corner, node 1, also has a large amount of events placed within it and the diagonally opposite node (12) has a decent number. Overall I would not have said that any of the nodes have notably fewer events, but further analysis shows that node 8 (middle right) is mostly populated by MHWs from one large event.

### Node summary table

The table below contains a concise summary of the nodes following Table 4 in @Oliver2018tasmania. The following sub-sections provide more in-depth explanations.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#                             MHW_Propeties = c(""),
#                             Conditions = c(""), 
#                             stringsAsFactors = F))

### Season + region

In the figure below we most quickly see that the proportion of MHWs occurring in the middle two nodes are summer events. The seasons are determined by the month during which the peak of the event occurred, with `Winter = JFM` etc. The nodes on the right-hand have mostly events centred around the mab and almost none in the nfs. The distribution becomes more even as we move to the centre with the left-hand nodes having mostly nfs and gsl events. Nodes 8 + 9 + 12 are primarily autumn/winter events.

```{r no-ls-season-summary, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/fig_5.png")
```

### SST + U + V

The only anomalous current pattern I see is that the centre nodes (6 + 7) and the opposite corners of nodes 1 + 12 show little strength/vorticity in the GS while the other nodes tend to show more. The strength of the GS is apparent in node 8, slightly less so in node 4 + 12, and the vorticity in the eddy field is very apparent in node 5. 

For SST we see moving from the right to the left the LS anomaly tends to go from cool to warm. As we move from the top down the AO tends to become warmer. The gm, gsl, and ss regions are warm in all of the nodes. Most of the SST is anomalously warm in the middle bottom four nodes (6, 7, 10, 11). 

```{r no-ls-sst-summary, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/fig_2.png")
```

### Air temp + U + V

For air temperature anomalies we see that the air above the LS gets warmer as we move left and down. The air over the USA becomes warmer as we move to the right. Most of the air in the middle bottom four nodes (6, 7, 10, 11) is warm. The air over the AO becomes warmer as we move down the nodes.

One consistent pattern across all of the wind anomalies is that the top row nodes strong anomalous movement down from the northeast corner while the bottom right corner nodes have strong northward wind anomalies in their northeast corners.

On the right-hand side of the nodes we see generally anticyclonic wind movement around a thermal dipole with the northward moving air being anomalously warm. The warmer (colder) the anomaly the faster north (south) the anomalous wind movement is. In the second right-most column (nodes 3 +7  + 11) we also see anticyclonic wind anomalies around thermal dipoles. The central position of the anticyclone is different in each node, and the thermal anomalies tend to be less than the right-hand column. The left-hand two columns have cyclonic wind movement around thermal dipoles with the stronger patterns in the far left column. Node 10 is a bit different in that it appears to have anticyclonic wind movement, but a cold dipole that looks more like the cyclonic movement nodes. The center two nodes have the smaller wind patterns, with node 6 the smallest.

```{r no-ls-t2m-summary, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/fig_3.png")
```

### MLD + Net downward heatflux

The MLD in the AO in the top nodes is generally deeper, and shoals as we move to the bottom row (with the exception of node 4). The MLD in the LS is deeper in the right-hand column and shoals as we move left. The MLD for the GS is deeper in the left-hand column and shoals as we move to the right.

The gradients of net downward heatflux change nicely across the nodes and generally speaking we see more positive downward heatflux over areas with anomalously shallow water. There is little happening in the centre two nodes. There is high positive downward heatflux over the LS + AO in the bottom left node (9) with negative heatflux over the GS. This positive heatflux gradient slowly moves over the AO as we move from the left to the right along the bottom row of nodes. There is a negative downward heatflux gradient over the GS in the top left node (1) that slowly moves up and over to the LS as we move towards node 4. This negative heatflux patch is replaced by a positive one.

```{r no-ls-mld-summary, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/fig_4.png")
```

### Node 1

This node has a pretty even split of seasons of occurrence. Most of the events took place in the nfs, cbs, or gsl. The most intense events in this node occurred in Autumn/Winter of 2010. There are events from 1999 to 2018 with more events in the later half. There is a big mix of many very small and a couple of large events for both cumulative and max intensities. There were several pulses of this event that caused MHWs in multiple regions simultaneously.

The LS and northern coastal waters are warm while the AO is fairly even. Looking closely one may see that the GS is slightly anomalously slow. The atmosphere is dominated by a cyclonic dipole offshore of the mab/gm. The AO is up to 20 metres deeper than usual with a negative downward heatflux over it and the GS. The LS is shallow but there is not much positive heatflux into it.

The MHWs in this node were caused by an any time of year cyclonic storm that is pulling air over LS that is warm there, but cooler relative to the southern reaches of the study area.

```{r no-ls-node-1, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_1_panels.png")
```

### Node 2

A very even distribution of MHWs across all regions. Mostly summer then spring. The occurrence of events spans 2000 -- 2016. The cumulative and max intensity of these events are very low. The occurrence of this pattern in autumn happened only twice, 2012 and 2013. When these events occur in winter they have a cumulative intensity of ~8. lol.

A cold AO with a warm yet very turbulent GS with many warm/cold core eddies. It is surprising how well the detail of the eddies comes through given that these are many different events over many years. The rest of the coastal waters and LS are all warm with relatively little movement. Air over AO is cold but warm everywhere else. Strong cyclonic wind anomalies over the area south of where the AO and LS meet. No wind movement over land where the air anomaly is warmest. Positive heatflux over LS, where MLD is slightly shallow. Negative heatflux over deeper AO/GS where it is approaching the LS. The many eddies show up here in a more unusual MLD pattern, too.

These events appear to be caused by a very large cyclonic storm pulling warm air down along the coastline. This anomalous wind movement is probably what is causing so many eddies.

```{r no-ls-node-2, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_2_panels.png")
```

### Node 3

These MHWs are split between winter and summer. There are about half as many MHWs in this node than normal at a count of 14. Most events occurred in the gsl and cbs. The occurrence of events spans only 2007 -- 2017, with most events occurring in the first half. The cumulative intensities are very low, but with normal max intensities.

Cold (warm) eastern (western) AO with warm water everywhere else. Strong eddies in the GS. There appears to be an anticyclonic cell pulling warm air up the coast and cold air over the AO. But there is also a cyclonic cell in the northeast corner that appears to be doing the same. There is little warm air movement inland. There is no positive heatflux in this node, and relatively weaker heatflux over some of the deeper MLD associated with eddies. Slightly shallower water in the coastal regions. 

These MHWs are caused by the meeting of two opposite rotating cells pushing warm air overland and onto the shelf.

```{r no-ls-node-3, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_3_panels.png")
```

### Node 4

These MHWs occurred almost entirely in the mab with a bit trailing out into the gm, ss and cbs. Half of the events occurred in Spring, with the other half split between the other three seasons. Low cumulative intensities, but mid-high max intensities. The MHWs that occurred in the mab tend to have higher max intensities. Events range from 1994 -- 2018 but mostly take place from 2014 onward.

Very clearly a strong + warm GS pushing up closer along the shelf during a cold LS. Warm air anomalies over US and GS with strong northward wind anomalies. Cold air over CN with southward air anomalies. These two air flows appear either unconnected or perhaps two separate cyclonic and anticyclonic cells. Positive heatflux into shallower GS with a strong negative flux into deeper point where the LS and GS meet.

This is a good example of a strong S causing MHWs in the southern regions of the study.

```{r no-ls-node-4, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_4_panels.png")
```

### Node 5

These are summer events with a bit spilling out into autumn and only 1 event in spring and winter. MHWs centred around nfs and decrease only slightly from there. Most events occurred between 2012 -- 2017. Two small events occurred in 1999. Low to high cumulative intensities but mid to high max intensities. The intensity of events in the autumn are greater than the summer. This could be due to phenology shifts of this storm pattern. Most MHWs occurred during two pulses of this pattern.

Slightly cool AO and  slightly warm GS with very turbulent eddy field. Warm SST anomaly everywhere else. Warm air anomaly over nearly all of the study area, hottest over the grand banks. Large cyclonic cell sitting over area where GS pulls away from coast. Slightly deeper MLD of waters along coast, possibly due to GS. Also slightly deeper MLD in GS at bottom of study area and in some eddy cores. Some small negative heatflux into mab/gm waters, and some positive heatflux over the GS as it travels out of the study area.

These northern focused MHWs are driven by warm air being pulled up over the ocean by a cyclone that first dumps the air onto nfs and less so from there, but does reach all the way down the coast.

```{r no-ls-node-5, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_5_panels.png")
```

### Node 6

A node with many MHWs clustered into it. An even number (8) of MHWs occurred in the mab and gsl, which is a bit strange. A couple less in the gm, ss, and cbs. Only 2 in the nfs. Almost all of the events occurred in summer, with 4 in autumn and 5 in spring. The cumulative intensities are medium high with a couple of very large MHWs. The max intensity on these events is very high on average, with several medium sized ones. Range from 1999 -- 2018. The MHWs in this node are the second largest.

Warm SST and air anomalies throughout entire study area. Note that the air temp anomalies are actually low, at less than 2.0, compared to most of the other nodes. Very little current anomaly and some faster northward air over US coast while some southward wind anomaly over AO. Wind in the north of the study area has slight northward anomaly. Very little happening w.r.t. MLD and heatflux (note scale bar). It is worth noting that there is no negative heatflux, and little positive heatflux.

This appears to be a classic "dog days of summer" pattern where warm air sits over the shelf for long periods of time and slowly warms the SST.

```{r no-ls-node-6, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_6_panels.png")
```

### Node 7

Roughly three quarters of events occurred in summer. Highest centre of occurrence in the gm at 11 MHWs, slowly decreasing out from there. Even though this is a mostly summer node, the summer events are small at a mean cumulative intensity of ~30. The MHWs in other seasons tend to be larger, with 3 of the 5 winter MHWs that occurred here being massive. The max intensity of events here are medium to very high, with one winter event in the mab having a max intensity over 4C! Summer events occurred like this from 1994 to 2017, but things really started to pick up in 2012 when this storm pattern started to occur in the other parts of the year. The MHWs in this node are the largest in the study.

A warm AO with a stronger GS and warm coastal waters but cold LS. Warm air over US - CN border with large anticyclone cell over eastern AO. Some pockets of positive MLD likely due to eddies. Some positive heatflux and no negative heatflux. It's strange that the maximum intensities are so high while the heatflux anomalies are low. The air and SST anomalies are higher than most nodes though.

This is a very interesting node as it shows primarily a mundane summer anticyclonic storm pattern of warm air being pulled up the coast and sent over the regions. Where it gets interesting is that this pattern then started occurring during any time of year and that is when the events become hectic. This is a clear example of a phenological change in coastal storms.

```{r no-ls-node-7, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_7_panels.png")
```

### Node 8

This node has only 15 MHWs clustered into it. Almost half of the MHWs occurred in the mab, with fewer in the other coastal regions further away. The main range of MHWs occurred from 2015 - 2017, with two small events in 2003 and one even smaller event in 2012. This node primarily consists of two events that occurred over autumn and winter of 2015/16. The order of the max intensities caused in the multiple regions during each pulse remained the same as seen in panel F. Most of the other smaller events from years outside of the two large pulses occurred in the mab as seen in node F.

Obviously strong coast-ward GS with a strong eddy field. High SST anomaly with a super cold core anomaly to the east. Crazy high (~5C) air anomaly over US and GS with concurrent northward winds. Cold southward flowing air from over the cold LS waters. It doesn't really look like this is one weather system, rather two. Crazy high positive heatflux (~200W/m2) over GS near the coast and very shallow AO, with equally massive negative heatflux over very deep LS. The heatflux anomalies in this node are roughly 4 times larger than most other nodes. 

The GS is pumping hard up into the study area and bringing a lot of hot air with it that is forcing its way down into the waters of the GS and coastal regions south of the cbs. I'm not sure what's going on in the atmosphere but it doesn't really look like an anticyclone.

```{r no-ls-node-8, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_8_panels.png")
```

### Node 9

Most MHWs occurred here in autumn and winter in either the nfs or cbs, with 4 in the ss. MHW occurrences range from 1999 -- 2017. These MHWs are very small.

Cold GS along coastline, with warm waters everywhere else. GS is moving a bit more quickly with some good eddy action. Cold southward air over CN, US, and GS. Very warm northward air over AO + LS. Strong negative heatflux over deep GS with massive positive heatflux into very shallow AO + LS. 

This is very clearly a cyclonic system moving up the coast bringing warm air out to the nfs and pulling cold air down over the mab and gm, mixing up the AO as it goes.Even though the atmosphere looks dramatic, this isn't creating large MHWs. They are probably very short. [Need to create a summary table of MHW metrics] 

```{r no-ls-node-9, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_9_panels.png")
```

### Node 10

Events centred in the nfs + cbs and decreasing as one moves further away. Focus towards autumn events but evenly distributed otherwise. The MHWs occurred from 1999 -- 2017. The MHWs in this node stand out a bit in that they occurred a bit more in concentrated clumps than usual. Meaning that we see multiple regions experiencing MHWs at the same time. The cumulative intensities are low but the max intensities are lo-medium to high-medium. There is an even spread of events over time.

We see a mostly warm SST anomaly everywhere but much higher to the south of the nfs. Slight cold anomaly in GS near coast. Very mild cold air over US + CN with very high warm anomaly over nfs. There appears to be a warm massive anticyclone centred over the LS but reaching down into the AO. Very little positive MLD to be found, with a very negative MLD anomaly for the AO and LS, but normal over the nfs. Large positive heatflux into he AO + LS. 

This looks like some sort of huge tropical storm coming from the east to bring warm air to the nfs but turns away/stops before reaching the coast of the US.

```{r no-ls-node-10, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_10_panels.png")
```

### Node 11

Relatively even spread of events with more in the mab and gsl. Half of the events occurred in spring and only 2 in winter. The range is from 1999 -- 2017 and well spread out. The largest MHW was in the cbs in 1999. Overall low cumulative intensities but medium to high max intensities. The winter MHWs are the smallest, with the summer and then spring events being the largest.

Mix of slightly warm and cold eddies in GS. Warmer waters to the north of the GS but less so in the LS. A very large anticyclone centred over the south of the nfs that is pulling warm air up onto the coast where it reaches nearly 5C over CN! Slightly deeper southern AO and GS eddies with most of the rest of the study area being slightly shallow. No negative heatflux and strong positive heatflux over AO, with some very strong localised heatflux within the gsl and nfs.

This is a mostly spring storm that is pushing warm air onto the coast coming from the southeast.

```{r no-ls-node-11, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/no_ls/node_11_panels.png")
```

### Node 12

An even spread between all regions except only 1 MHW in the nfs. Slightly fewer in gsl and cbs. Almost all events occurred in autumn and winter, with only 1 spring event and 2 in summer. Range is 2003 -- 2017. These events are tiny, but some have medium max intensities. Also note that the first half of the time series these events are only occurring in the autumn, and mostly winter in the second half.

A warm gulf stream and coastal waters with spotty LS. Very warm air over US + CN with northward wind anomaly over the GS + AO. There appears to be an anticyclone happening over the entire study area, centred south of where the AO and LS meet. A generally shallower MLD for the GS and AO, with a deep tongue in the LS. No negative heatflux with high positive heatflux into GS + AO.

This appears to be a big anticyclone that is sitting over the AO in autumn - winter that is pushing a bunch of warm air over and into the coastal regions, excluding the nfs as the colder LS appears to maybe be blocking this.

## Comparison of SOM experiments

I find it easiest to see the similarities/differences between the SOM experiments by looking at atmospheric panels. If one clicks back and forth between the 4x3 and 3x3 default SOM node figures it becomes apparent that the left and right-hand columns of nodes are effectively the same, and it is the middle columns that are combined when going down from a 4x3 to 3x3 grid. We can see this amalgamating of the central columns in all of the physical variable figures. Their is a however a difference in the patterns in the nodes between the regions and seasons of occurrence. I attribute this to the SOM not wanting to bunch up too many values in one node, so with the 3x3 grid it distributes the largely summer MHWs in the centre two nodes from the 4x3 grid out to other nodes where it sees fit. 

The MHWs in the middle column(s) tend to be a bit larger, which may also be why they have "smoother" looking patterns that can be binned together more easily into other nodes in a 3x3 grid. So the question then becomes, what do we gain by allowing the center column to be split or not? I am actually going to argue that the 4x3 grid is preferable because we can see that the top two nodes in the middle left column show cyclonic wind anomalies while the other middle nodes show anticyclonic wind anomalies. This important detail is lost with a 3x3 grid.

That being said, when we filter out all events shorter than 14 days, 6 of the 9 nodes in the resultant 3x3 grid look very similar to the default 3x3 grid. Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 are definitely the same pattern, though the results appear sharper in the filtered MHW result. Nodes 4 and 7 in the filtered SOM resembles the patterns in node 7 and 4 of the default SOM, though they are relatively different. Node 8 in the default 3x3 SOM shows a clearer pattern with a different overall wind pattern than node 8 of the filtered SOM. Overall though I think this can be taken as support for the idea of using the filtered results. That the patterns in these nodes are mostly similar to the default 3x3 node can argue that the loss of the nodes from the 4x3 grid isn't that important as they don't reflect the patterns seen during the larger (more important) events.

So basically I have no firm conclusion on which way to go. But having to argue for why we used only 14+ day long MHWs will be a pain, so maybe it's just easiest to go for the 4x3 grid. The season pattern comes through best on that grid anyway.
