This website contains the version controlled analyses used to determine the primary drivers of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.
  
Please use the tabs above to navigate the site. The "Analyses" tabs contain workflows for discrete portions of the overall analysis. To see the raw code used for the workflow/pipeline of this project please follow the link in the top right of this page to the `source code` for this project. Once there the raw workflow code may be found in the `code/workflow.R` script. The functions etc. that this script relies on may be found in the `code/functions.R` script.
