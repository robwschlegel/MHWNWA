<!-- # What are known drivers of past MHWs? -->

<!-- - Advection, heat flux, and intrinsic ocean modes are the primary drivers of sea surface temperature (SST) [@Deser2010].   -->
<!-- - Different regions of the world show different primary drivers for anomalously warm SST.   -->
<!-- - MHWs in the coastal oceans are primarily driven by abnormal movement of warm currents onto the coast [@Schlegel2017predominant; @Oliver2018tasmania].   -->
<!-- - For large seas like the Mediterranean, heat flux is dominant [@Garrabou2009].   -->
<!-- - Events in the open oceans tend to be driven by a combination of factors [@Bond2015a]. -->

<!-- # Why use a new method to determine drivers? -->

<!-- The current standard is to analyse the drivers of one large MHW at a time.   -->
<!-- MHWs are occurring too rapidly to spend a year understanding the drivers of an individual event.   -->
<!-- Smaller events that would normally escape our notice may also be important.   -->
<!-- Machine learning may be a better choice moving forwards.   -->

# Calculating MHWs and creating synoptic states

- All of the SST pixels within each sub-region (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1)) were averaged together into one time series.  
- MHWs were calculated from these averaged time series.  
- The start and end dates of each MHW were used to create a packet of synoptic information (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-2)).  

# Self-organising maps

- Are there recurrent environmental patterns during MHWs?  
- If so, can these be detected/quantified/clustered by a computer?  
- Environmental data during MHWs are fed to the SOM to produce 12 most common states (nodes).  

# What do the results look like?

- Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3) shows the results from node 9 of the SOM.  
- In this node we see a clear nor' easter pattern.  
- The centre of the heat anomaly has a deeper mixed layer and negative downward heat flux.  
- The MHWs occurred predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (mab) region.  
- No overall seasonality, but more recent events occurring in spring and increasing in intensity.  

# Conclusions

<!-- - The SOM technique functions better in the Northwest Atlantic if the Labrador Sea is excluded from the study area -->
<!--   - This is important to note as it supports the argument that this methodology is limited in scale -->
<!--   - It is likely that this SOM technique will not work on scales larger than one meso-scale feature at a time -->
- The nodes tell three main stories:
  - Warm GS + air pushing up from south along coast
  - Warm air sitting over entire coast
  - Warm air being pushed over the AO from the South/Southeast onto the coast
- Overall the most intense MHWs occur during Autumn/Winter when they match patterns that are normally seen in Summer
- To see all of the results please follow the QR code.  

<!-- - A few nodes tell smaller stories: -->
<!--   - Short lived storms that barely manage to perturb T~mix~ for long enough to qualify as a MHW -->
<!--   - Distinct from the patterns that cause intense MHWs -->

<!-- # Future work -->

<!-- Extend the methodology seen here into the third and fourth dimensions of the data.   -->
<!-- Run this same analysis 1, 2, 3, etc. months prior to the MHWs to see how well it detects patterns.   -->
<!-- Test these drivers (node synoptic states) as predictors for events in different data products.   -->
<!-- Rank the drivers by their predictive accuracy.   -->
<!-- Create operational prediction data layer for public use/consumption.   -->
