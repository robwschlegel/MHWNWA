# Introduction

- Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are 5+ day long events when temperature anomalies exceed the 90th percentile climatology [@Hobday2016; @Hobday2018].  
- There are many different drivers of MHWs known around the world [e.g. @Olita2007; @Deser2010; @Bond2015a; @Schlegel2017predominant; @Oliver2018tasmania].  
- Are there common/recurrent drivers of MHWs in the NW Atlantic?  
- If so, can these be detected/clustered/quantified by a machine?  

# Methods

- SST pixels within each region of the coast (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1)A) were meaned together into one time series.  
- MHWs were calculated from these 6 mean time series (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1)B).  
- The start and end dates of each MHW were used to create mean synoptic air/sea state anomalies (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-2)).  
- These mean anomalies were fed to a self-organising map (SOM) to produce the 12 most common air/sea states (nodes). 
- Humans are then used to infer the drivers from the 12 nodes.

# Results

- To see all of the results please follow the QR code.  
- The node 9 results show a clear Nor'easter pattern (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)B).  
- The centre of the high SST anomaly (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)A) has a deepening MLD and negative downward heat flux (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)C).  
- Most MHWs occurred northwest of the centre of the SST anomaly (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-4)A) due to the downward heat flux and shoaling MLD (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)C). 
- None of these events occurred in summer (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-4)B), and nearly half occurred on the Newfoundland Shelf (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-4)C).  

# Conclusions

- The nodes show three predominant patterns:
  - Warm Gulf Stream + air pushing up from south along the coast.
  - Warm air sitting over the entire coast during summer.
  - Warm air pushed over the Atlantic from the southeast onto the coast.
- The most intense MHWs occur during Autumn/Winter when large scale atmospheric patterns look like Summer MHW conditions.

<!-- - The SOM technique functions better in the Northwest Atlantic if the Labrador Sea is excluded from the study area. -->
<!--   - This is important to note as it supports the argument that this methodology is limited in scale.   -->
<!--   - It is likely that this SOM technique will not work on scales larger than one meso-scale feature at a time.   -->
