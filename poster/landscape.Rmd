# Introduction

This research uses the @Hobday2016 and @Hobday2018 definitions for marine heatwaves (MHWs) and their categories and was conducted using the {heatwaveR} implementation of the algorithm [@Schlegel2018]. 
<!-- These events are increasing in duration and intensity around the globe [@Oliver2018].  -->
It is not yet known what the primary drivers are of MHWs in the Northwest Atlantic. We use here a methodology from @Schlegel2017predominant and @Oliver2018tasmania to implement a self-organising map (SOM) to determine the primary synoptic patterns in several key abiotic variables. 
The data used in this research were from the NAP (3-Oceans) model.

<!-- Many coastal, oceanic, and polar regions with ecosystems/species that are vulnerable to these events [@Smale2019] do not have optimal sea water temperature time series available for the detection of MHWs.    -->
<!-- An optimal time series is defined here as meeting these two primary requirements: 1) 30 years long, 2) no missing data. Any time series shorter than 30 years long or missing any data is therefore sub-optimal. The purpose of this study was to determine how confident we may be in our results when using sub-optimal data. -->
  
## Objectives

1. Find the primary drivers of MHWs in the Northwest Atlantic  
2. Determine if these drivers occur during certain seasons  
3. Determine if these drivers have relationships with specific regions

# Methods

- Regions created along coast of Atlantic Canada based on @Richaud2016
- Sub-regions created based on bottom depth within region
- SST time series made for each region from average of pixels therein
- MHWs calculated from each average SST time series
- Average anomaly abiotic synoptic states created during each MHW
- Anomalies fed to SOM to produce 12 most common states
- The occurrence of these states with sub-regions and/or seasons quantified

<!-- - Reference time series from the `heatwaveR` package [@Schlegel2018] were re-sampled 100 times and made increasingly sub-optimal by: -->
    <!-- - Removing one year of data; 37 -- 10 years -->
    <!-- - Randomly removing 1% of data; 0 -- 50%  -->
    <!-- - Adding linear trend of 0.01°C/dec.; 0.00 -- 0.50°C/dec. -->
<!-- - The effect on an entire time series and one focus MHW (Figure \@ref(fig:event-flames)) were measured -->
<!-- - The sub-optimal treatments were performed on global NOAA OISST product and effects measured -->

```{r event-flames, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Focus MHWs from the three reference time series: A) Western Australia, B) Northwest Atlantic, C) Mediterranean. Start/end dates shown with light-green marks.', fig.height=2}
knitr::include_graphics("~/MHWdetection/LaTeX/fig_1_flat.png")
```

# Results

- The primary difference in synoptic states is a dipole between a warm (cold) Gulf Stream and cold (warm) Labrador Sea (Figure \@ref(fig:synoptic-sst))
- More nuanced patterns are .....
- Sub-mesoscale patterns are ......
- By season ......
- By region ......

<!-- - MHWs detected with 10 years of data do not differ significantly from those detected with 30 years of data (Figure \@ref(fig:length-KS))   -->
<!-- - 20% missing data or less does not have an appreciable effect on the MHWs in a time series, but this can impact individual MHWs by dividing them up into smaller events \@ref(fig:effect-event))   -->
<!-- - Individual MHWs in 10 year time series around the globe are on average 10% less intense (Figure \@ref(fig:global-intensity)) and 28% shorter than the same event in a 30 year time series   -->
<!-- - The shifting up or down of the mean climatology is the primary driver of change in individual events   -->
<!-- - The change in the count of events is caused by missing data   -->

<!-- ``` -->

# Conclusions

The SOM technique was able to determine common synoptic states during MHWs.  
The primary driver was .....  
Another imprtant drivers was ....  
The sub/region with the most ....
The season with the most ....

This work may be used in the development of predictive models for MHWs.  

<!-- The MHW detection algorithm provides robust results that are insensitive to sub-optimal data challenges.   -->
<!-- Missing data has a greater effect on MHWs than time series length. Linear interpolation is an effective fix for missing data up to 40%.   -->
<!-- Time series length has a less predictable effect than missing data.   -->
<!-- The shifting up or down of the mean climatology is the primary driver of change in MHWs.   -->
<!-- Optimal data should still be used when possible. -->
