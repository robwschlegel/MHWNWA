# What are known drivers of past MHWs?

* Advection and heat flux are primary drivers of SST
* Different regions of the world show different primary drivers
* For much of the coastal oceans the primary driver is abnormal movement of warm currents onto the coast
* For large seas (i.e. the Mediterranean) warm air plays a more important role

# Why use a new method?

* Current standard is to analyse the drivers of one large event at a time
* Smaller events may also be important
* Events are happening too rapidly to spend a year working on them one at a time
* Machine learning may be a better choice moving forwards

## Sub/regions

- The coastline of Atlantic Canada was divided into several regions based on @Richaud2016
- These regions were then divided into three sub-regions each based on bottom depth:
  - 0 - 50 m
  - 50 - 200 m 
  - 200+ m

![](graph/fig_2.png)

- The region abbreviations are: 
  - `gm` = Gulf of Maine 
  - `gls` = Gulf of St. Lawrence
  - `ls` = Labrador Shelf
  - `mab` = Mid-Atlantic Bight
  - `nfs` = Newfoundland Shelf 
  - `ss` = Scotian Shelf
  
  ## Calculating MHWs and creating synoptic states

- All of the SST pixels within each sub-region were averaged together into one time series
- MHWs were calculated from these averaged time series
- The start and end dates of each MHW were used to create a packet of synoptic state information

![](graph/fig_3.png)


## Self-organising map

* Are there recurrent environmental patterns during marine heatwaves?
* If so, can these be detected/quantified by a computer?
* Anomalies fed to SOM to produce 12 most common states
* The occurrence of these states with sub-regions and/or seasons quantified

# What are the primary drivers? {.tabset}

## Broad view of SST

- The primary difference in synoptic SST states is between a warm (cold) Gulf Stream and cold (warm) Labrador Sea 
- We do not see a state during which the entire study area shows a warm SST signal

![](../output/som_plot_sst_anom.png)

## Focus on node 9

* Strong warm nearshore Gulf Stream current
* Deeper mixed layer and negative downward heat flux
* Predominantly time series from the Mid-Atlantic Bight
* No seasonality, with more recent events increasing in intensity

![](graph/fig_4.png)

# Conclusions

* The SOM technique functions as expected in the Northwest Atlantic
* The lack of a completely warm SST 'flavour' was surprising
* Each node tells a different complex story

# Future work

* Extend the methodology seen here into the third and fourth dimensions of the data
* Run this same analysis 1, 2, 3, etc. months prior to see how well it works
* Test these drivers (node synoptic states) as predictors for events in different data products
* Rank the drivers by their predictive accuracy
* Create operational prediction data layer for public use/consumption
