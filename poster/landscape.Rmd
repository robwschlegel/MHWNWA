# What are known drivers of past MHWs?

Advection, heat flux, and intrinsic ocean modes are the primary drivers of sea surface temperature (SST) [@Deser2010].  
Different regions of the world show different primary drivers for anomalously warm SST.  
MHWs in the coastal oceans are primarily driven by abnormal movement of warm currents onto the coast [@Schlegel2017predominant; @Oliver2018tasmania].  
For large seas like the Mediterranean, heat flux is dominant [@Garrabou2009].  
Events in the open oceans tend to be driven by a combination of factors [@Bond2015a].

# Why use a new method to determine drivers?

The current standard is to analyse the drivers of one large MHW at a time.  
MHWs are occurring too rapidly to spend a year understanding the drivers of an individual event.  
Smaller events that would normally escape our notice may also be important.  
Machine learning may be a better choice moving forwards.  

# Self-organising maps

Are there recurrent environmental patterns during MHWs?  
If so, can these be detected/quantified by a computer?  
Environmental data during MHWs are fed to the SOM to produce 12 most common states (nodes).  

# Calculating MHWs and creating synoptic states

All of the SST pixels within each sub-region (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1)) were averaged together into one time series.  
MHWs were calculated from these averaged time series.  
The start and end dates of each MHW were used to create a packet of synoptic information (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-2)).  

# What do the results look like?

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3) shows the results from node 5 of the SOM.  
In this node we see a strong warm nearshore Gulf Stream current.  
The centre of the heat anomaly has a deeper mixed layer and negative downward heat flux.  
The MHWs occurred predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (mab) region.  
No overall seasonality, but more recent events occurring in spring and increasing in intensity.  

# Conclusions

The SOM technique functions as expected in the Northwest Atlantic.  
Each node tells a different complex story.  
Many of the nodes show drivers that occurred over a few years or less.  
Most of the nodes show drivers that occur during specific seasons.  
Drivers usually affected multiple regions concurrently.  
To see all of the results please follow the QR code.  

# Future work

Extend the methodology seen here into the third and fourth dimensions of the data.  
Run this same analysis 1, 2, 3, etc. months prior to the MHWs to see how well it detects patterns.  
Test these drivers (node synoptic states) as predictors for events in different data products.  
Rank the drivers by their predictive accuracy.  
Create operational prediction data layer for public use/consumption.
