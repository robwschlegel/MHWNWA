# Introduction

- Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are 5+ day long events when temperature anomalies exceed the 90th percentile climatology [@Hobday2016; @Hobday2018].  
- There are many different drivers of MHWs known around the world [e.g. @Garrabou2009; @Deser2010; @Bond2015a; @Schlegel2017predominant; @Oliver2018tasmania].  
- Are there common/recurrent drivers of MHWs in the NW Atlantic?  
- If so, can these be detected/clustered/quantified by a machine?  

# Methods

- SST pixels within each region of the coast (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1)A) were averaged together into one time series.  
- MHWs were calculated from these 6 averaged time series (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-1)B).  
- The start and end dates of each MHW were used to create mean synoptic air/sea state anomalies (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-2)).  
- These mean anomalies were fed to a self-organising map (SOM) to produce the 12 most common air/sea states (nodes). 
- Humans are then used to infer the drivers from the 12 nodes.

# Results

<!-- - Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3) shows the results from node 9 of the SOM.   -->
- To see all of the results please follow the QR code.  
- In node 9 we see a clear Nor'easter pattern (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)C).  
- The centre of the high SST anomaly (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)B) has a deepening MLD and negative downward heat flux (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)D).  
- Most MHWs occurred northwest of the centre of the SST anomaly (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)A) due to the downward heat flux and shoaling MLD (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)D). 
- None of these events occurred in Summer (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)G), and most events occurred on the Newfoundland Shelf (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-3)H).  

# Conclusions

- The nodes tell three main stories:
  - Warm Gulf Stream + air pushing up from south along coast.
  - Warm air sitting over entire coast.
  - Warm air being pushed over the Atlantic from the South/Southeast onto the coast.
- Overall the most intense MHWs occur during Autumn/Winter when they match patterns that are normally seen in Summer.
- The SOM technique functions better in the Northwest Atlantic if the Labrador Sea is excluded from the study area.

<!--   - This is important to note as it supports the argument that this methodology is limited in scale.   -->
<!--   - It is likely that this SOM technique will not work on scales larger than one meso-scale feature at a time.   -->

<!-- # Future work -->

<!-- Extend the methodology seen here into the third and fourth dimensions of the data.   -->
<!-- Run this same analysis 1, 2, 3, etc. months prior to the MHWs to see how well it detects patterns.   -->
<!-- Test these drivers (node synoptic states) as predictors for events in different data products.   -->
<!-- Rank the drivers by their predictive accuracy.   -->
<!-- Create operational prediction data layer for public use/consumption.   -->
